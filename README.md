# Overview

For this project the goal was to print the basic "Hello World" phrase to the screen. This is to demondstrate the proper setup of the software and installation of python as a programing language on my computer.

In this software I took an extra couple of steps to personalize and make it my own by printing what the software was for in the first line. In the second line print the required information. In the third line print who created it. I also took steps to comment my work in my program for easy changing and finding of code.

As stated above my purpose in creating this sopftware was to demonstrate the proper instalation of softweare and other tools.

Here is a video demo of this software (sorry for the far out zoom): [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/l9qCHno0iPk)

# Development Environment

For this project I used Visual Studio Code, the supplied assignment instructions, and the supplied readme.md file, youtube, and github.

For this project I used python becuase it was the last programming language I used two years ago.
