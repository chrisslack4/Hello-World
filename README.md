# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
For this project the goal was to print the basic "Hello World" phrase to the screen. This is to demondstrate the proper setup of the software and installation of python as a programing language on my computer.

{Provide a description of your software}
In this software I took an extra couple of steps to personalize and make it my own by printing what the software was for in the first line. In the second line print the required information. In the third line print who created it. I also took steps to comment my work in my program for easy changing and finding of code.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
As stated above my purpose in creating this sopftware was to demonstrate the proper instalation of softweare and other tools.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

Here is a video demo of this software (sorry for the far out zoom): [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/l9qCHno0iPk)
